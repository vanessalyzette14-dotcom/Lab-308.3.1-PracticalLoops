# Objectives
-   Use for loops to iterate a specific number of times.
-   Use for of loops to iterate through iterable data-like strings.
-   Use while loops to iterate based on a condition.
-   Use the break and continue statements to control loop flow.

## Instructions
Initialize a new git repository in a local project folder, and create a JavaScript file to contain your code. Complete the activities below. For each of the activities, decide whether it is best to use for, for of, or while loops to implement the solution.
Commit frequently! Every time something works, you should commit it. Remember, you can always go back to a previous commit if something breaks.



# Loops and Iteration

## Loop Types:

- for (basic) - for(intializer; condition; afterthought){}
- for in loop - used for looping through iterables, declared variable represents index number
- for of loop - used for looping through iterables, declared variable represents index VALUE (char or object at that index)
    -   Do NOT use if you need access to the index
-   while loop - similar to a for loop but does not contain logic to end like a for loop does
-   do-while loop - same as while loop, but check the conditiona last, so loop ALWAYS runs at least once.

## Vocab:
-   continue - control flow keyword. It skips the rest of current iteration and goes to next run through of loop
-   break - control flow keyword. It breaks out of CURRENT loop to continue with rest of program
